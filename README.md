### Pomodoro
I wanted to try out Vue, so I chose a simple pomodoro timer.  I had already built an Angular todo app and a React weather app, so the next idea was a pomodoro. So yeah, it isnt anything special... just yet another pomodoro app.

### Vue
I have built a couple of things in React, and this simple project in Vue. And, I like Vue better. Alot better. It was simpler and more obvious at every turn. So, unless I am compelled to use one of the other frameworks, Vue will be my framework of choice.
